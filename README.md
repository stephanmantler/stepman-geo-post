# stepman-geo-post
A wordpress plugin to provide geolocation to posts &amp; pages. There are of course already similar plugins out there, but this is a convenient project for me to become more familiar with modern development for the Gutenberg editor.

## Getting Started

This repository only contains the raw sources and requires a development environment to build the actual plugin. In addition to the source code, this plugin currently requires a [Mapbox access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/).

Run `nppm install && npm run build` to build the actual plugin.

Then, go to the Dashboard and under Plugins->stepman paste your access token.
