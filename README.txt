Provides flexible maps and universal geolocation support for posts and pages.

== Description ==
A wordpress plugin to provide geolocation to posts & pages and display interactive maps (optionally with annotations). Uses [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) for map display. Supports [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org), [OpenTopoMap](http://opentopomap.org) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) base maps, custom WMTS raster sources and GeoJSON vector overlays.

== Installation ==
Install plugin as usual. To use Mapbox instead of OpenStreetMap or OpenTopoMap, you will need a [Mapbox access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/). After receiving your token, go to Plugins -> Super Map Box and paste the token in the appropriate text field.
